Manufacture with Copy Machines
==============================

Printing the inner signatures
-----------------------------

- xerox a test page to ensure the printer is in good working order (i.e. no streaks or whatever)
- set for 2-up onto 2-up printing
- create something like 10 copies at once
- if paying CAD, $0.04 per side is an okay rate
- thus, it costs about $6.25 to print 136 sheets
    + note: this really isn't too bad, based on cost alone.
    + The mass print-to-order rate would be about 50%
    + ...but this is much lower scale production so 50% is tolerable
